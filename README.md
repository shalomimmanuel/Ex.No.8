Exp. No.: 8 – Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation
Name: Shalom P
Reg. No.:212223050047
Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by
crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details
to generate an image as close as possible to the original.
Apparatus/Tools:
• AI Tools/Models Used:
o DALL·E (OpenAI)
o Stable Diffusion
o MidJourney
Procedure:
1. Analyze the Given Image:
Carefully observed the image to identify:
o Objects/Subjects
o Colors
o Textures
o Lighting
o Background
o Composition
o Style
2. Create the Basic Prompt:
Wrote a simple description of the main subject in the image.
3. Refine the Prompt with More Detail:
Added details about color, mood, time of day, and composition.
4. Identify the Artistic Style:
Included keywords representing the visual style such as realistic, cartoonish, watercolor, etc.
5. Adjust and Fine-tune:
Improved the prompt by mentioning textures, background elements, and perspective.
6. Generate the Image:
Used the selected model (e.g., DALL·E or MidJourney) to generate the image.
7. Compare and Iterate:
Compared the generated image with the original and refined the prompt if required.
Example (Fill for Each Image):
Image 1
Original Image:

Basic Prompt:
A girl sitting on a park bench under a tree.
Refined Prompt:
A realistic image of a young woman sitting on a wooden park bench under a large oak tree during
autumn. Golden leaves scattered on the ground, warm sunlight filtering through the branches, calm
and serene mood.
Final Prompt Used for Generation:
Realistic digital artwork of a young woman sitting on a park bench beneath a tall oak tree with
golden autumn leaves. Sunlight rays filtering through branches, warm soft light, natural background,
peaceful mood, ultra-detailed, high resolution.

Comparison Report:
Aspect Original Generated Observation
Objects Girl, tree, bench Girl, tree, bench All main elements present
Colors Warm golden tones Slightly brighter tones Minor color variation
Lighting Natural sunlight Soft diffused light Close match
Composition Center-focused Slightly shifted focus Acceptable
Style Realistic Realistic Well reproduced
Result:
The generated image closely matches the original, with only minor variations in color and lighting.

Basic Prompt:
A snowy mountain landscape.
Refined Prompt:
A peaceful snowy mountain scene with pine trees, soft blue sky, and sunlight reflecting off the snow.
Final Prompt Used for Generation:
Ultra-realistic photograph of a mountain covered with snow, surrounded by tall pine trees, clear blue
sky, sunlight reflecting on snow peaks, serene winter atmosphere, crisp lighting.

Comparison Report:
Aspect Original Generated Observation
Objects Mountains, trees, snow Mountains, trees, snow Perfect match
Colors Blue-white Blue-white Same color scheme
Lighting Bright natural light Bright with more contrast Minor difference
Composition Wide-angle Similar wide frame Excellent reproduction
Style Realistic photo Photorealistic Very close match
Result:
The generated image successfully reproduces the original with high accuracy in colors, composition,
and realism.
Conclusion:
By using precise and descriptive prompts, the AI-generated images closely matched the originals. The
results show that prompt refinement significantly improves the quality and resemblance of the
generated images. Tools like DALL·E and MidJourney effectively demonstrate how text-to-image
generation can replicate real-world visuals for creative and academic applications.
